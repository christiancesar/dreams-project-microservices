Dreams is an academic project, developed with the aim of testing the microservices architecture. This project is part of my Bachelor's Degree in Information Systems from the Federal University of Mato Grosso (Campos de Rondonópolis), currently the Federal University of Rondonópolis.
This project is being based on:
* "Microservices Patterns" by Chris Richardson;
* "Monolith to Microservices" by Sam Newman;
* "Developing Microservices with Node.js" by David Gonzalez;
* "Building Microservices" by Sam Newman;
* "Dive Into Design Patterns" by Alexander Shvets;

To test applicability, use will be made of some APIs such as:
* Amadeus (Flight and Hotel Consultation)
* Ethereum (nodemailer, SMTP service)

Strategy Proto Files Sharing
 I use module npm to share proto files with ApiGateway and Microservices.
